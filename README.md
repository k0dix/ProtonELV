# ProtonELV
(with an emphasis on *expendable*)

A companion homebrew for https://github.com/XorTroll/uLaunch

At the moment it can swap qlaunch with uLaunch and reboot to payload backing up everything useful you might have in the process. 

Planned features: online install, nigthly builds. 

It began as a mod for https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/tree/master/troposphere/reboot_to_payload I wrote while learning C.
