# ProtonELV
(aka “Proton expendable launch vehicle” with an emphasis on *expendable*)

A companion homebrew for Nintendo Switch that might prove useful if you are into https://github.com/XorTroll/uLaunch.

It can swap stock Home menu qlaunch with uLaunch and reboot to payload backing up everything useful you might have had in your “contents” folder in the process. 

## Installation and setup 
Download uLaunch’s release, place /ulaunch from the release to the root of your SD card, create a folder named “ProtonELV” (without quotation marks, duh) inside /ulaunch. Place the contents of /atmosphere/contents (pun not intended; four folders) from the uLaunch’s release into /ulaunch/ProtonELV.  
Download ProtonELV https://github.com/octopuserectus/ProtonELV/releases and delicately place it into /switch.

## Controls
Controls are explained via on-screen prompts. 

## Planned features
Online installation and update, install nigthly builds, not suck in general. 

## Credits
Let’s be honest, it’s just a few extra lines of code inside https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/tree/master/troposphere/reboot_to_payload.
